    <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p id="para1">
            I am an asipiring digital archivist/digital preservationist with hopes of 
            preserving information and making items available digitally for years to come. With my degree in 
            informatics, I hope to have a solid technological background that enables me to 
            seek the proper ways in which to archive both physical and born-digital materials. Overall, some big goals I have are 
            to get a Masters in Library and Information Science with a focus in digital curation and
            to get a long-standing job at the New York Public Library Digital Archives. I would also like 
            to gain some experience with UI/UX or Web Devolopment as a side hustle because I find these disciplines to be 
            fun.

                <strong>B & B Apache Cactus in Mesa, AZ as a swap meet employee and cashier.</strong> <br> As a swap meet employee, I                                        
                handled transactions regarding cactus gardens, cactus, pottery, and fun keepsake items relating to Arizona. 
                Also I maintained the booth's cleanliness, provided customer service to those who have questions about our products, 
                worked independently with little instruction while also handling any situations that arose.
                I also had cashier duties such as giving change, managing the amount of money in the cash register, and entering the price of items correctly. 
                The job also required heavy lifting including cement statues and other heavy items such as large cactus gardens and large cacti.

            <p>
                <strong>Library in Tempe, AZ as a library desk aide.</strong> <br> As a student worker and a library aide, I assist students when questions arise while also lending items that the library loans such as chargers, books, calculators, etc. 
                Moreover, my duties include book pulls (grabbing books that students have requested), interacting with students, and using my knowledge to answer their questions or concerns. 
                I also navigate the ASU library databases/website/ALMA to assist students with research, class work, and independent projects when applicable.
                As a library aide I also constantly interact with community members and ensure they have a seamless experience using the library. 
                I also help guide students and community members alike to their destination by providing spoken directions and giving out maps of the library to aid them to their destination. 
                Occasionally, I also guide students to locations across the ASU campus and have a comprehensive knowledge of the building and services on campus.
